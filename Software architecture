An Application is a collection of services.
---------- Software Architecture -----------
Four types:
    1. One-Tier (Tier means layer or server)
    2. Two-Tier
    3. Three-Tier
    4. N-Tier
--- Server: It is like a big computer which serves the services to end users.
There are three types of servers:
1.	Web server 		2. App server 		3. db server
------ Web server --------
-	It is also called the presentation layer.
-	To show the application
-	Who works: UI/UX developers/front-end developers
-	What they use: web technologies
-	Example: html, css, js, etc.
------- App server -------
-	Also called the logic layer
-	 To use the application
-	Who works: back-end developers
-	What they use: programming languages
-	Example: Java, Python, C, C++, .NET, Go, etc.
-------- db server --------
-	Also called db layer
-	To store and retrieve data
-	Who works: DB admins
-	What they use: database languages
-	Example: SQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Arango, etc.
All three layers are connected with SSH to each other.

-------- One tier architecture    -----------
-	Create standalone applications that work on a local laptop.
-	It will not require any internet connection.
-	Ex: VLC media player
-------- Two Tier Architecture -----------
-	Client-Server application that works on a local laptop.
-	Local: Presentation, Logic		DB: Internet
-	It will require an internet connection.
-	Ex: Banking applications
-------- Three Tier Architecture -----------
-	Web application (Real Time), does not require on local laptop.
-	Everything we can use from internet.
-	Ex: YouTube, Instagram, WhatsApp


------------ Implementation of Architecture ----------------
TO CREATE SERVER WE NEED TO HAVE CLOUD ACCOUNT.
AWS: EC2 INSTANCES = ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD
TO CREATE EC2 WE NEED TO PERFORM 7 STEPS:
SERVER = COMPUTER
1. TAGS = NAME
2. AMI OS, SOFTWARE PACKAGES
3. INSTANCE_TYPE = CPU & RAM
4. KEY_PAIR = LOGIN (public=aws, private user)
5. NETWORK = VPC, SECURITY GROUPS (port numbers=0-65535)
6. STORAGE = 8 GB -16 TB
7. SUMMARY = TO REVIEW 
SSH= SECURE SHELL (22) TO COMMUNICATE WITH SERVERS
