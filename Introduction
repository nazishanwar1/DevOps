Why DevOps? TO deliver an application speedily.
SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle.
In the software domain, we have 2 teams for developing the application:
    ---->  1. Development (Plan, Code, Build, Test)          
----Plan: Create a plan for the application
----Code: Select the language to write the application
----Build: Adding dependencies.
----Test: Checking the accuracy of an application.
    ---->  2.  Operation (Deploy, Operation, Monitoring)
----Deploy: The process of installing an application on a server. (Developer develops a code on a local laptop, which an end user can't use, so to make it usable, he has to install it on a server.)
----Operation: updating, configuring
----Monitoring: Checking the application's functioning at the server level.
